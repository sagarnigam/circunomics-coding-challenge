# Frontend Coding Challenge

## Introduction

You have been tasked with creating a new feature for our events app using the latest version of Angular.  The feature will let users view speakers in the app.
It will consist of two views, a list view and a details view.  You can use any other framework you like to help with styling etc..   The app should be architectured (specifically the folder structrure) in way that will scale to a large enterpise sized app.

Note: This is purely for testing purposes and the feature will not be used by us in any form.

## Instructions

1. Create a new GitHub repo and commit the basic app scaffolding
2. Fetch the speakers from the api using the endpoint "https://randomuser.me/api/?results=20&page=1'" (the results and page will need to change accordinlgly)
3. Display the speakers in a **paginated** list (only show the details you deem suitable)
4. Add a search box to filter the list
5. When a user clicks a speaker it should navigate to a "details" view
6. Once again the details view will display any information about the speaker you deem suitable
7. Add unit tests

Extra points if you can build it with NgRx.

You will need to add me(dandouglas) as a collaborator to the repo once you have finished.

## Requirements

The app must:
1. Be presentable
2. Be optimised for performance
3. Display a good knowledge of the main Angular concepts and best practices
   
You should also *commit regularly* and follow the [Angular guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines) for commit messages.  Example commit message: "fix(people list): people not showing"

Good luck!
